Ignore this first chunk of code

```{r, setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggrepel)
library(yaml)
```
# Drinks
## Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```

See below a clear representation of the variable types and further details to our relevant data  

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
glimpse(drinks)

```
The code below will show us a plot of the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}

beer <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(beer_servings))

top25_beer <- beer %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(top25_beer, aes(x= beer_servings,
       y = reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ labs(x="Beer Servings Consumed Per Person",y = "Country", title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries")

```

The code below runs & presents the top 25 wine consuming countries (no suprise, the French REALLY like their wine)

```{r wine_plot}

wine <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, wine_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings))

top25_wine <- wine %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(top25_wine, aes(x= wine_servings,
       y = reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ labs(x="Wine Servings Consumed Per Person",y = "Country", title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries")

```
Lastly, lets run the code below to see the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

spirit <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, spirit_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings))

top25_spirit <- spirit %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(top25_spirit, aes(x= spirit_servings,
       y = reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ labs(x="Spirits Servings Consumed Per Person",y = "Country", title = "Top 25 Spirits Consuming Countries")

```

In conclusion, we see that alcohol is generally loved all over the world. Some countries have different tendencies towards different types, but after a long day of work everyone loves a nice drink. Cheers!
