If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

We run the code below to see this.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

```{r tidyweather}

weather_selected <- select(weather, Year:Dec)
weather_selected_long <- weather_selected %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, #columns 2 to 13
               names_to = "Month",
               values_to = "delta")


```

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- weather_selected_long %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```
As one can see above, the delta consistenty increased through the 20th century

Now lets analyze whether or not the increased temperature is more pronounced in certain months more than others

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

#Your code goes here...


tidyweather <- weather_selected_long %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies by Month"
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~month)



```


We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. 

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Below the code will construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation
```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval== "2011-present") %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
    filter(!is.na(delta)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta), sd_delta = sd(delta), count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.95, count-1),
            se_delta = sd_delta/sqrt(count),
            margin_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            rating_high = mean_delta + margin_error,
            rating_low = mean_delta - margin_error)

formula_ci
```
Here the bootstrap code

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta


set.seed(1234) 

# bootstrap for mean annual delta, from 2011-present, with 1000 replications:

delta_boot <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% 
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

percentile_ci <- delta_boot %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

percentile_ci %>% 
  select(c(lower_ci,upper_ci)) %>% 
  kbl(col.names=c("Mean Annual Delta (2011-Present): Lower Limit", "Mean Annual Delta (2011-Present): Upper Limit")) %>%
  kable_styling()

```

We can see from the analysis that the two tests provide similiar confidence intervals
