#  Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). 



```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this chllenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# We are viewing the FRED data
tickers <- c('TB3MS',
             'TB6MS', 
             'GS1',   
             'GS2',   
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yield_curve_1_done,  out.width="100%"}
yield_curve %>%  
  mutate(maturity = fct_relevel(maturity, c("1y","10y","2y","20y","3m","3y","30y","5y","5m","7y"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=price, color = factor(var))) + 
  #We use geomline to view it as a line
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~var, nrow = 5) +
  labs(x="", 
       y="Percentage", 
       title="US treasury yields post-1960", 
       caption="Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Econoomic Database") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r yield_curve_2_done,  out.width="100%"}
yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(facet_year = year(ymd(date)), facet_month = month(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(facet_year >= 1999) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=price, color = factor(facet_year),group = factor(facet_month))) +
  #We use geomline to view it as a line
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~facet_year, nrow = 6) +
  labs(x="Maturity of bond", 
       y="Percentage Yield", 
       title="Yield Curve", 
       caption="Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r yield_curve_3_done,  out.width="100%"}
yield_curve %>% 
  # For this analysis we are only interested in 3 months or 10 years
  filter(maturity == "3m" |  maturity=="10y") %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  # We only want to view from post-1999
  filter(year >= 1999) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=price, color = var)) +
  #Use geomline to create a line
  geom_line() +
  labs(x="", 
       y="%", 
       title="10 year and 3 month treasury yields", 
       caption="Source: St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database") + 
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

The code below will yield us our final desired graph

```{r yield_curve_4_done,  out.width="100%"}
recessions <- recessions %>% filter(To >= as.Date("1960-01-01"))

yield_curve %>% 
  # We are focusing on bonds with a 3 month and 10 year maturity
  filter(maturity == "3m" |  maturity=="10y") %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(delta = lead(price) - price ) %>% 
  filter(maturity == "3m") %>%
  #Use a ggplot to map the data
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=delta)) +
  #Use geomline to create a line
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  labs(x="", 
       y="The difference between 10 year and 3 month yield (%)", 
       title="Inversion of yield curve difference between 10 year and 3 months", 
       subtitle="The difference in basis points",
       caption="Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Banks of St Louis ") + 
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = date , ymin = 0, ymax = if_else(delta<0, delta, 0)  , alpha=0.5, fill = "A")) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x =  date, ymin = 0, ymax = if_else(delta>0, delta, 0),alpha=0.5, fill = "B")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#CD8382","#08519D"), name="") +
  geom_rect(data=recessions, inherit.aes=F, aes(xmin=From, xmax=To, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf), fill='grey', alpha=0.5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  # Rescaling the data makes it easier to view as exemplified
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 years", date_labels = "%Y")  +
  geom_rug(aes(colour=ifelse(delta>=0,">=0","<0")),sides="b",alpha=0.5) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("#CD8383","#08519C"), guide=FALSE)
```


- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.
